ANS 1: SCREEN SHOTS OF PROGRAM HAS BEEN ATTACHED






ANS 2:

DFSInputStream : 
                   

•	Handles communication of the namenodewith various datanodes.
•   Handles integrity of data contained by the blocks.
•   Manages data read activity in case of datanodefailure.
•   Called internally by FSDataInputStream.


FSDataInputStream :
        

Provides stream (channel) for reading data.


FSDataInputStream
Lets the application read from a file
FSDataInputStreamin = null;
in = fs.open(new Path(uri));


FSDataOutputStream :

Provides stream (channel) for writing data.

OutputStreamout = fs.create(new Path(dst));
IOUtils.copyBytes(in, out, 4096, true);


DFSOutputStream :

•	Handles communication of the namenodewith various datanodes.
•	Called internally by FSDataOutputStream.
